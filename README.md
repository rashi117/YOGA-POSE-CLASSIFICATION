# YOGA-POSE-CLASSIFICATION
TrainDataset_keypoints_extraction and TestDataset_keypoints_extraction : python files having code to get the keypoints on the images of the train and test dataset.

YogaPose_ClassificationModel : Contains the SVM and RF model to prediction the pose of the image of test dataset.

Accuracy through SVM and RF came out to be 93% and 92% respectively after the hyperparameter tuning.
But performance of SVM was better than RF based on precision and recall scores for all the poses.
